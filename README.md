# html-recipes

Started the "The Odin Project" and this is the first project assignment to do.

The task is to create a basic website using ONLY HTML.

The objective is to learn HTML for a beginner.

Personally, I don't think this is necessary for me, as this is for people starting HTML, but I decided to do it for consistency's sake.
